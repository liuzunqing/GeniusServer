# GeniusServer
It is the first java Server Project I had participated in.
It uses Serverlet to send and receive messages between
server and client. The client is Android APP.
It aims to become the e-shopping application with it's
client. You can't get client code here cause that the client
was compiled with Android Studio.
The server code was compiled with Eclipse-jee.
Now, just take it a sample.
